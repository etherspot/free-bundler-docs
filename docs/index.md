# UserOps Developer Guide

Welcome to the comprehensive developer guide for working with **EntryPoint v0.8** and **UserOperations (UserOps)**. This documentation provides everything you need to understand, implement, and submit UserOps using the latest EntryPoint contract.

## 🚀 What is EntryPoint v0.8?

EntryPoint v0.8 is the latest version of the core contract in the ERC-4337 Account Abstraction ecosystem. It serves as the central hub for processing UserOperations, enabling:

- **Account Abstraction**: Smart contract wallets with custom validation logic
- **Gasless Transactions**: Sponsored transactions through paymasters
- **Batch Operations**: Multiple operations in a single transaction
- **Enhanced Security**: Improved validation and anti-DoS mechanisms

## 🎯 Key Features

!!! success "New in v0.8"
    - **EIP-7702 Support**: Native support for EIP-7702 authorizations
    - **Enhanced Security**: Improved validation mechanisms
    - **Better Gas Optimization**: More efficient gas usage patterns
    - **Improved Error Handling**: Better error reporting and debugging
